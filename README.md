# Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Cleaning & Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates various **text preprocessing** and **feature engineering** techniques used in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to prepare textual data for machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **advanced text preprocessing techniques** on raw text data and convert it into numerical form that can be used by ML algorithms.

## ðŸ›  Techniques Covered
- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of HTML tags, special characters, extra spaces, numbers, etc.
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, removing stopwords, handling contractions, and text normalization.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form using algorithms like PorterStemmer and SnowballStemmer.
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base dictionary form using WordNetLemmatizer.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words, sentences, or tokens.
- **Vectorization**:
  - **Bag of Words (BOW)**
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**
  - **Word2Vec Embeddings**


## ðŸ“Š Applications
- Sentiment Analysis
- Document Classification
- Chatbot Development
- Information Retrieval
- Fake News Detection
- Recommendation Systems
